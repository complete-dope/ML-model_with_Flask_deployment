# ML-model_with_Flask_deployment
> First of all using this model in your local system you can either fork the project or clone the project 

> Secondly go the required folder by ```cd/required_folder ``` 

> Make the necessory imports by ``` pip install numpy , sklearn , pandas ```

> This model uses the minimal flask required for deployment and also has a very basic ML model 

> Run the following command:

  ``` python model.py ```
  
  > The above command should output 
  - Most probably a warning (which we can ignore)
  - array([0])
  - Model is working
  
  ## If these 3 lines are visible in terminal then you are well with the model ðŸ˜‰
  
> Run the command
``` python app.py  ```

>Then go the link [localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000) and there you can see your Model ðŸ˜Ž
